RTG Example Reference Files
===========================

These files illustrate how to specify a reference.txt file that is
used inside a formatted reference to allow sex-aware mapping, variant
calling, and analysis. For standard human references choose one of
these examples that matches the version and chromosome naming
convention of your reference.  You may need to manually adjust the
chromosome names if you are using NCBI identifiers rather than chrNN
or NN style. See the user manual for more information on reference.txt
specification and how to carry out sex-aware mapping and variant
calling.
